        <div><p>For centuries, cultures have come up with creative ways to artistically approach,<br>
            adopt, and adapt the paper craft. While many of these practices, including Korean Hanji,<br>
             can be individually traced to specific countries of origin, most—including papier–mâché,<br>
              a French-sounding craft that was actually conceived in ancient China—boast colorful histories<br>
               that span cultures, countries, and even continents. One popular practice that has left a particularly <br>
               extensive paper trail across the globe is origami, the art of paper folding.<br><br>
               Though most closely tied to Japan, origami also has roots in China and Europe. Here, <br>
               we explore the practice's unique history to understand how each culture has shaped the<br> 
               beautiful and beloved art form.</p></div>

            <div><h2>What is Origami?</h2></div>
            <div><p>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”)<br>
                 and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper <br>
                 (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.<br>
                </p></div>

            <div><h2>History of Origami</h2></div>
            <div>Creatives from several countries helped shape origami into the practice it is today.<br><hr><h3>China</h3>
                <br>Paper was invented in China around 105 AD, and folded paper—or zhezhi—most likely<br>
                 emerged shortly after. By 900 AD, paper yuanbao, or gold nuggets, were a staple at<br>
                  traditional Chinese funerals.</h3></div>

                  <div><p>Created by meticulously folding gold or yellow paper into ingot currency, these ephemeral <br>
                    ornaments were crafted with the intention of being thrown into a fire at the end of the<br>
                     ceremony.</p></div>
                     <img src="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/history-of-origami-6.jpg">
                     
                     <div><p>Eventually, paper-folding would become a common practice. Though similar to Japanese<br>
                         origami, more modern Chinese paper-folding exhibits an interest in representing inanimate<br>
                          objects, like boats and boxes.</p></div><br>

                       <hr> <div><h3>Japan</h3><p>Paper was introduced to Japan in the 6th century. During this time, the practice of paper-<br>
                            folding emerged as a ceremonial Shinto ritual. It was not until Japan's Edo Period (1603 –<br>
                             1868) that origami would also be viewed as a leisurely activity and art form.</p></div>

                        <div><p>Like Japanese woodblock prints—an art form that also saw popularity during this time—<br>
                            origami works often featured flowers, birds, and other nature-based motifs. These subjects<br>
                             are also prevalent in contemporary origami, which remains true to the traditional Japanese<br>
                              practice in all ways but one: originally, the practice allowed artists to strategically cut the<br>
                               sheets of paper. Today, however, true origami is sculpted entirely through folds—an attribute<br>
                                the Japanese adopted from Europe.</p></div>

                       <hr> <div><h3>EUROPE</h3><p>In Europe, paper-folding is thought to have evolved from napkin-folding, a practice<br>
                             popularized in the 17th century. Much like Japanese origami, napkin-folding featured<br>
                              different methods and techniques that resulted in an array of abstract and figurative forms.</p></div>
                              <img src="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/history-of-origami-7.jpg">
                              <div><p>Eventually, this interest in folding moved beyond napkins at dinner parties and made its <br>
                                way into schools—namely, in Friedrich Fröbel‘s groundbreaking curriculum.</p></div>

                                <div><p>As the founder of kindergartens, Fröbel incorporated several hands-on activities into his<br>
                                     “play and activity” institutes, including paper-folding. This familiarized children with origami,<br>
                                      and eventually enabled the art form to flourish across the continent.</p></div><hr>
